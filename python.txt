Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, 
dynamic programming language.[23][24] 
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and 
its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code 
than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.[25][26] 
The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on 
both a small and large scale.[27]
